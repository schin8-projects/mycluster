## Notes

Interface eth0 is for the internal networ, wlan0 is for external access.  This differs from Jeff's setup in that he's initially connecting his dramble to the network and then changing the ips. I've also customized the hosts.j2 file to use a leading zero for the hostname. i.e.

```
10.0.1.{{70+loop.index}} kube{{"%02d"|format(loop.index)}} kube0{{"%02d"|format(loop.index) }}.local
```



# Raspberry Pi Networking Setup

When you plug a fresh new Raspberry Pi into your network, the default configuration tells the Pi to use DHCP to dynamically request an IP address from your network's router. Typically this is a pretty random address, and it can make configuration annoying.

To keep things simpler, I elected to jot down the MAC addresses of each of the Pis' onboard LAN ports (this stays the same over time), and map those to a set of contiguous static IP addresses so I can deploy, for example, the balancer to 10.0.1.60, the webservers to 10.0.1.61-62, and so on.

The playbook and configuration in this directory will automatically perform all the required networking configuration to make this so.

To run the playbook:

  1. Copy `example.inventory` to `inventory`, and list all your Raspberry Pi's _current_ IP addresses under `[dramble]`
  2. Copy `example.vars.yml` to `vars.yml`, and make sure each Pi's MAC address is mapped to the desired final IP addresses and hostnames.
  3. Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml`.

> _Note_: If you don't have your SSH key installed on all the Pis yet, you will also need to pass `-k` to the above command and enter your SSH password (the default for Raspbian is `raspberry`).

Assuming everything went well, the Pis should switch over to their new IP addresses quickly; if they don't, you can forcefully reboot them with the command:

    $ ansible all -i inventory -m shell -a "sleep 1s; shutdown -r now" -b -B 60 -P 0

Now you should be able to run the main Dramble playbooks on your Pi cluster!

## Updating hostnames or IPs

If you ever need to change active Dramble networking info, it's easy! Just change the IP addresses inside the `inventory` file to the active IP addresses of your Pis and run the playbook again, then reboot all your Pis again.

## Manual Networking Setup

_If you don't want to use the automated playbook, you can do the following on each Raspberry Pi individually_:

  1. Set a unique hostname (e.g. `kube1.pidramble.com` for the first server, and `kube2.pidramble.com` for the second server):

     1. Edit `/etc/hostname` and replace the existing hostname with the new hostname.
     2. Enter `hostname [new-hostname]` to update the hostname immediately.
     3. Edit `/etc/hosts` and replace the existing hostname with the new hostname.

  2. Set up the network settings for our Pi network:

     1. TODO - these instructions changed with Raspbian Stretch.
     2. Restart the Pi: `sudo reboot`
     3. You'll need to reconnect to the Pi on its new static IP address.

The networking configuration may need to be a little different depending on the environment in which you're using your own Dramble (whether it's on an isolated private network, connected to another network/router, using bridged WiFi interfaces, etc.).
